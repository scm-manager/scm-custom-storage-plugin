This documentation describes the usage of scm-custom-storage-plugin. It is available in different languages and versions,
which can be selected in the menu on the right.

The Custom Storage plugin adds the possibility to change the storage paths of existing repositories and specify the
default paths for new repositories. With this it is possible to create repositories outside the default repository path,
but also to get paths with the namespace and name of the repository. This is one of the most wanted feature, but please
use it with care!
